Connection to arduino are as follows :--

Dht sensor   :-
A0 = A0 (of arduino)
Vcc = 5V
GND = GND

Rain detector sensor :--
A0 = A1(of arduino)
D0 = pin 4
VCC = 5V
GND = GND

Lcd (16 x 2) :-
SDA = A4
SCL = A5
VCC = 5V
GND = GND

Led all (red , green, blue) :-
Led red positive = 11
Led green positive = 10
Led  green positive = 9
All led Negative pins at GND of arduino

A tip : Always use less than 300 ohm registors for LED's as direct supply can cause damage.

For buzzer  :-
Positive pin of both buzzer at separate p.t = 7 and 6
Negative pin to GND of arduino
